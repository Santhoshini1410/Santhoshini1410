            <p>1914: Most celebrated spiritual leadrers of India.</p>

            <p>Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and one of the most celebrated spiritual leaders of India.
            <p> He was more than just a spiritual mind; he was a prolific thinker, great orator and passionate patriot. 
            <p>He carried on the free-thinking philosophy of his guru, Ramakrishna Paramhansa forward into a new paradigm.
            <p>The brotherhood lived off on alms donated voluntarily by patrons during holy begging or ‘madhukari’, performed yoga and meditation.
            <p> Vivekananda left the Math in 1886 and went on a tour of India on foot as a ‘Parivrajak’.
            <p> He travelled the breadth of the country, absorbing much of the social, cultural and religious aspects of the people he came in contact with. 
            <p>He witnessed the adversities of life that the common people faced, their ailments, and vowed to dedicate his life to bring relief to these suffering.
            <p>During the middle of 1885, Ramakrishna, who had been suffering from throat cancer, fell seriously ill.
            <p> In September 1885, Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Shyampukur in Culcutta, 
            <p>and a few months later Narendranath took a rented villa at Cossipore. Here, he formed a group of young people who were ardent followers of Sri Ramakrishna and together they nursed their Guru with devoted care. 
            <p>On 16 August 1886, Sri Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body.</p></div>
